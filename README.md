- 👋 Hi, I’m @elijah-chou
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering, with a specific interest in either back-end engineering or cloud development. Really just out here trying to get as much experience as I can. I've interned at JPMorgan Chase & Co., Georgia Tech Research Institute, and AT&T with software development projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning graduate-level Information Retrieval, Text Processing Neural Networks, and Biostatistics for Machine Learning. However, I have taken various other classes such as Data Structures, Algorithms, Computer Vision, Human AI Interaction, Systems Programming, Information Visualization, and Machine Learning. I have experience with Java, Python, JavaScript, C, and R. Some major frameworks and systems I've worked with include Kubernetes, Apache Kafka, Spring Boot/Integration, and Apache Airflow. I have certifications as a AWS Cloud Practictioner (CLF-CO1), as a Terraform Associate (003), in ISC2's Certified in Cybersecurity (CC), and in Apache Airflow Fundamentals!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of project that I will either be able to contribute a lot or learn a good deal of new technologies.
