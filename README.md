- 👋 Hi, I’m @elijah-chou
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering in general, but I would love to work with any webpages using JavaScript/React.js or any Java/Python implementations. Really just out here trying to get as much experience as I can.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning graduate-level machine learning and information visualiztion (InfoVis) research. However, I have taken various other classes such as Data Structures, Algorithms, Systems Programming, and undergraduate-level Machine Learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of project that I will either be able to contribute a lot or learn a good deal of new technologies.
- 📫 How to reach me: personal email is ecool7079@gmail.com; Emory email is elijah.chou@emory.edu; professional email is elijah.chou0321@gmail.com. You can also reach out to me via my phone number +1 (518) 903-9531, but I would highly appreciate it if you reached out to me via email beforehand! :)
