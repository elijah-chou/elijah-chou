- 👋 Hi, I’m @elijah-chou
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering in general, but I would love to work with any webpages using JavaScript/React.js or any Java/Python implementations. Really just out here trying to get as much experience as I can. I've interned at JPMorgan Chase & Co., Georgia Tech Research Institute, and AT&T with software development projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning graduate-level algorithms, computer vision, and human AI interaction. However, I have taken various other classes such as Data Structures, Algorithms, Systems Programming, Information Visualization, and Machine Learning. I have experience with Java, Python, JavaScript, C, and R. Some major frameworks and systems I've worked with include Kubernetes, Apache Kafka, Spring Boot/Integration, and Apache Airflow. I am also certified in AWS Cloud Practictioner and Apache Airflow Fundamentals!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of project that I will either be able to contribute a lot or learn a good deal of new technologies.
