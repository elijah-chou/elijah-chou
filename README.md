- 👋 Hi, I’m @elijah-chou
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering, with a specific interest in either back-end engineering or cloud development. Really just out here trying to get as much experience as I can. I've interned at JPMorgan Chase & Co., Georgia Tech Research Institute, and AT&T with software development projects.
- 🌱 I have taken various classes such as Data Structures, Algorithms, Computer Vision, Human AI Interaction, Systems Programming, Information Visualization, Machine Learning, Information Retrieval, and Text Processing Neural Networks. I have experience with Java, Python, JavaScript, C, and R. Some major technologies/frameworks/systems I've worked with include Kubernetes, Apache Kafka, Spring Boot/Integration, and Apache Airflow. I have certifications as a AWS Developer - Associate (DVA-C02), as a AWS Cloud Practictioner (CLF-CO1), as a Terraform Associate (003), as a MongoDB Associate Developer, in ISC2's Certified in Cybersecurity (CC), and in Apache Airflow Fundamentals!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of project that I will either be able to contribute a lot or learn a good deal of new technologies.
